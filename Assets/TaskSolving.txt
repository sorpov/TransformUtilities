Task will be solved in 2 steps:

1. Extends Transform with new methods, which will calculate often used logic with position, angle and camera;
2. Write wrapper to help use new extension more intuitively, and allow calculation in one Update;

Extension methods can be used directly by calling: transform.DistanceToTransform(target), to help developers make additional checks,
or in component init with one line: TransformsHandler.CheckTransform(transform).IsHaveTargetInRadius(Target, distance).RespondTo(RespondMethod);

Problems with this solution:
1. Extension methods DistanceToPosition and GetAngleToPosition cannot be wrapped in TransformsHandler due vector structs caching, but they can be used directly from code;
2. Same in angle checking: in wrapper using only transform.forward vector to check, but custom direction can be setted in direct method calls;
